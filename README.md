# üç• Naruto Shinobi Tournament Simulator

Welcome to the Shinobi Tournament Simulator. This is a single-elimination tournament web application built with React, allowing users to select characters from the Naruto universe and simulate battles based on a custom, lore-driven game logic.


## üåü Key Features
#### External API Integration: Uses the public Dattebayo API to search for and fetch character data.

#### Tournament Modes: Supports 8, 4, and 2-fighter single-elimination brackets.

#### Lore-Based Combat Logic: Battle outcomes are determined by a weighted formula combining character stats with critical lore factors (Jinchuriki status, Kekkei Genkai, Legendary Clans).

#### State Persistence: Utilizes localStorage to save and restore the current state of the bracket and selected fighters, allowing users to resume a tournament after refreshing the page.

#### Responsive Design: The bracket is visually optimized for both mobile (vertical stacking) and desktop (horizontal grid) views.
